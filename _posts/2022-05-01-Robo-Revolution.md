### Key Responsibilities
- Manage the C++ side of the project
- Minor asset creation as well as graphic design work for elements such as posters and game cases
- Level design in engine and on paper
- Creation of a modular asset kit for level assembly
- Created core mechanics such as trash pickup, robot abilities and upgrades, and a zone checklist

### Project Summary

Unfortunately due to circumstances of other project members and university work requiring more focus, this project was put on an indefinite backburner. I do still intend to continue this project some day, as it was a fun dive into some of the technical challenges of making such a game. Namely, ecnvountering issues such as level design with an unusually shaped character, as well as managing large numbers of actors without an impact to frame time.

The assets made for this game were split between me, and my at the time partner, who has since left the project. I was mostly responsible for more complex meshes as well as items requiring grpahic design and artwork. The game features a series of levels, ranging from various rooms of a family home, to environments such as coffee shops, and even missile silos. It is planned that development shall expand to include a lot of larger levels too, such as warehouses and office buildings.

As this was a work-in-progress project, only core prototyping features have been implemented, such as a limited sample of the playable characters and their abilities, as well as the other core mechanics needed for playing the game such as collecting trash, as well as checklists for clearing sections of rooms.

This game initially proposed a lot of technical challenges with the engine, as it was my first look at how C++ is implemented within the engine, as well as a deeper dive into thinks like memory management and optimization, especially surrounding the usage of soft object references.
