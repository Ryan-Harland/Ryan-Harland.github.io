- Assemble the environment and plan the tutorial mechanics

### Project Summary

This project marked my first real venture into designing something in Unreal Engine, this was a project of many firsts, learning how the engine worked, learning about the engine's core gameplay framework, as well as diving into aspects of object orientation. Naturally with such a project came many challenges we had to overcome. Utilising behaviour trees was particularly challenging as it was an unfamiliar concept and required me to adapt my way of thinking about how code is executed.

The result of this project suffered heavily from it's intended outcome due to scope creep, hence the eventual focus on a tutorial level. All gameplay mechanics and environment deisgn was done by me, with the modelling being shared between me and my partner. The aim was to create an environment that looked scrappy, and something to be expected in such a setting, for this reason a lot of buildings are made from shipping containers, or various wooden and sheet metal buildings.

The gameplay mechanics for the tutorial remained very simple. Basic survival mechanics were implemented such as stamina, hunger, thirst and health, as well as a weapon system with 1 available gun. Interaction systems were also implemented to allow the user to press buttons and interact with doors.

Simple zombie melee AI was also implemented to encourage a combat challenge in the final areas of the tutorial. The testing level of this project also served as grounds for another AI implementation for a different module, which was a simple wildlife AI, in which rabiits could hop around, flee from the player when scared, and automatically seek out food when hungry.
